This is course assignment for 'Getting and Cleaning Data'
Data description
The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.


### The raw data

It is critical that you include the rawest form of the data that you have access to. This ensures
that data provenance can be maintained throughout the workflow.  Here are some examples of the
raw form of data:

* The strange [binary file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) your measurement machine spits out
* The unformatted Excel file with 10 worksheets the company you contracted with sent you
* The complicated [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data you got from scraping the [Twitter API](https://twitter.com/twitterapi)
* The hand-entered numbers you collected looking through a microscope

You know the raw data are in the right format if you: 

1. Ran no software on the data
1. Did not modify any of the data values
1. You did not remove any data from the data set
1. You did not summarize the data in any way
